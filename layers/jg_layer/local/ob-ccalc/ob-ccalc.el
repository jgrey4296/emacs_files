;;; Commentary:

;; Org-babel support for prolog.
;;
;; To activate ob-prolog add the following to your init.el file:
;;
;;  (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/ob-prolog-dir")
;;  (org-babel-do-load-languages
;;    'org-babel-load-languages
;;    '((prolog . t)))
;;
;; It is unnecessary to add the directory to the load path if you
;; install using the package manager.
;;
;; In addition to the normal header arguments ob-prolog also supports
;; the :goal argument.  :goal is the goal that prolog will run when
;; executing the source block.  Prolog needs a goal to know what it is
;; going to execute.
;;
